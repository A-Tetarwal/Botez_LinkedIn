# Botez_LinkedIn
## Solution Overview
### This solution uses Google's Custom Search JSON API to search for LinkedIn profiles based on a job title or keyword and location. I used the requests library to make API calls and BeautifulSoup to parse the search results.

## Prerequisites
### - Google Custom Search JSON API key
### - Google Custom Search Engine ID

## What achieved
### Job title
### LinkedIn search via custom google search
### Variable number of results
### Link to profile
### All without scraping LinkedIn

## Extra
### For better code readability, within the functions, text is also added in double quotes.
